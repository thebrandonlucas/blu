- The Payjoin Team won the 2025 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon by building proof of concept integrations for [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/), [Liana](https://wizardsardine.com/liana/), and the first known [implementation](https://github.com/thebrandonlucas/interactive-payjoin) of Payjoin in the browser using WASM bindings from Payjoin Dev Kit [PDK](payjoindevkit.org) to Javascript, which doubled as an interactive tutorial for how Payjoin works.

## [Supercharging Transactions with Async Payjoin - TABConf 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPzvLxv0YfQ)

- I gave a talk on the origins, history, and implications of the newly developed [BIP 77]() a.k.a Async Payjoin, and how this dramatic improvement in Payjoin UX opens the door to mass wallet adoption and thus huge financial and privacy savings for all of Bitcoin at large.

## [Micropayments and the Lightning Network - Voltage Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vq6foKst54&t=124s)

- I did a workshop on the history of micropayments on the web, why they failed, and how the invention of the [Lightning Network]() on Bitcoin is making that original dream for the web a reality.
