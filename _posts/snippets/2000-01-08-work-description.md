# **Work**

---

I started out by working at Chick-fil-A in the kitchen, then as a programmer for corporate.

Most of my work since then has been in Bitcoin: one of the most fascinating
technological developments of our time and the most promising of the emergent currencies.

I work at Voltage in pursuit of that curiosity, working on streamlining
payments via the Lightning Network.

I also work on numerous Bitcoin side projects, primarily Payjoin: a novel method
that makes transactions more scalable, cheap, private, efficient, and fun.

It is believed that if we can get even a small percentage of the total number of Bitcoin transactions
to use Payjoin, we can break the most common metric used to spy on people today: The Common-input Ownership Heuristic.
