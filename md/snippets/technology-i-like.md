# **Technology**

---

The Ancient Greek word for technology: τεχνολογία, is a combination of two words: τέχνη (craft, art) and λόγος (word, knowledge, idea, etc).

Thinking of technology in terms of "knowledge of the craft" is useful, and I like thinking about _what my technology is supposed to be_ rather than _what it is_ or simply not think about it at all before I use it. Technology, like everything physical, always falls short of some ideal that it was meant to be, but today making technology annoying at best and physically or psychologically costly and painful at worst is a norm. It has been really damaging to our collective psyche to not set more stringent parameters around what technology we are and aren't willing to use and make. But in an age in which life's petty comforts reign supreme and dominate all our greatest decisions, this isn't really good.

To my amazement, most people are actually very willing to acknowledge the sorry state we're in: many have been sold on the idea that social media is generally worse for you than having none at all, or that Facebook and Google are extremely immoral companies to be mining our data and selling it to the highest bidder or our naked pictures to government perverts without our permission, or that Alexa shouldn't be listening to all our conversations and phoning home at Amazon every ten seconds, or that Apple shouldn't plan their obsolescence with the intention of grifting the customer out of more money. But then, after you talk about this with them, there's a sort of listless, defeated shrug, as they once again whore themselves out to their phone.

Imagine a family which sits at the dinner table discussing how terrible meth is for you, then

The beautiful thing, though, is that open source is getting better and better

Here's a list of technology that I like. I'm not sponsored in any way by any of the below, just a big fan. All of the software on this list is Open Source:

## Software

### Terminal or TUI (Terminal UI) tools

I'm a growing fan of the speed, universality, and simplicity of terminal-based tools and use them more and more exclusively in my software repertoire.

- [neovim](): The ultimate terminal-based editor, once you take the time to learn its ins and outs. The only thing lacking is when genuinely useful new proprietary software (i.e. AI coding agents) comes out, there's really no financial incentive for anyone to build on neovim vs the bought and paid for editors like [Windsurf]() or [Cursor]() which most devs will use, so we have to wait for charitable hobbyists to create suitable integrations, and I've run into plenty of frustration when trying to get coding agents to work within `neovim`.
- [nb](): A beautifully simple note-taking system for the terminal. Uses `git` to manage versions, has built-in file encryption, and much more. I use this with `neovim` for everything I write.
- [yazi](): An awesome file navigator that's very powerful and flexible. Stop using `cd <path>` to navigate everywhere!
- [`lazygit`](): This is the best way to use `git` I have ever discovered. It truly makes things easy and doesn't require you to memorize all those weird commands. Also integrates with `neovim`

### Languages

- [Elm](): This is one of the few (if only?) language I've used where I actually love the _language_ and not just what I'm building. Despite its sad lack of leadership and usage falling by the wayside, the idea of a language that makes websites never cause exceptions (in other words, if it compiles, it works) is a huge leap forward for web development. I don't know if I can go back to Javascript after having this experience, and may pursue one of Elm's actively maintained spiritual successors, such as [Gleam](). This website is built in Elm, by the way.

### Package Management

- [Nix](): Technically, Nix is a language, package manager, and operating system all at once, but it's purely functional guarantees have incredible downstream consequences which I write about at [nix.fun](https://nix.fun)

### Operating System

- [NixOS]()
- [Hyprland]()

### Bitcoin

- [Sparrow Wallet]()
- [SeedSigner]()

### Hardware

- [GrapheneOS](): The most secure smartphone in existence
- [ESP-32]()
- [Framework Laptop 13]()
- [Raspberry PI 0]()

### Fun

- [btop]()
