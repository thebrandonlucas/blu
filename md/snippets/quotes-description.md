# **Quotes**

---

I keep a collection of quotes I find interesting from various sources. In general, I try to keep these to things I can directly reference (wouldn't it be amazing if the internet broadly held to these standards?), so I write the book, link, or other source I read it in. The quotes are simply added to a JSON file that lives [here](/quotes/quotes.json). Feel free to use this (growing) database for your own use.
