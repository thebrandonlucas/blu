> The more peculiarly his own a man's character is, the better it fits him.

- Cicero, [_On Duties_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/47001/47001-h/47001-h.htm)

Hi, I'm Brandon Lucas. I'm a software engineer working at [Voltage](https://www.voltage.cloud) on making [sound money for the digital age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) better.

I'm starting this blog primarily for the following reasons:

- To think more clearly
- To learn more deeply, widely, and frequently
- To write things I don't see others writing that I wish someone had written
- To "be more peculiarly my own"
- To [find interesting people](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query)

What will you find here?

My plan is to write articles on technical, historical, philosophical, or anything-else-I-find-interesting-ical topics.
Shorter posts will be under /blog, longer posts under /articles, and interesting quotes I come across under /quotes.

I'm interested in Bitcoin, history, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), biographies, psychology, privacy, philosophy, programming, and more. Using [books as a vibe proxy](https://visakanv.substack.com/about) for the blog, here are some that have had a big impact on me:

- The Open Society and its Enemies by Karl Popper
- The Life of Greece by Will Durant
- Caesar and Christ by Will Durant
- Extreme Privacy by Michael Bazzell
- The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson & William Rees-Mogg
- Mastering the Lightning Network by Andreas Antonopoulos
- Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song
- Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos
- John Adams by David McCullough
- Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! by Richard Feynman
- Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon
- GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
- The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky
- Awakenings by Oliver Sacks
- Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky
- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- On the Shortness of Life by Seneca
- A Confession by Lev Tolstoy
- Modern Man in Search of a Soul by Carl Jung
- Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche
- Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
- The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

To leave you with one more, again from Cicero:

>  [Gratitude] is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.

- [_Defense of Cnaeus Plancius, Ch. 33, Section 80_](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DPlanc.%3Achapter%3D33%3Asection%3D80)

I agree; *Prima Gratia*!
